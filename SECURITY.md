## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our slum detection model and its users is important to us. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure
1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** the maintainers privately at: [security contact email]
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Wait** for our response before public disclosure

### 📋 Vulnerability Report Information
Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., data leakage, code injection, etc.)
- **Location** of the vulnerable code (file path, line numbers)
- **Step-by-step reproduction** instructions
- **Potential impact** and exploitation scenarios
- **Suggested fix** if you have one

### 🚨 Security Concerns for ML Models

#### Model Security
- **Adversarial attacks** on input images
- **Model poisoning** through malicious training data
- **Model extraction** and intellectual property theft
- **Privacy leakage** from training data

#### Data Security
- **Sensitive location data** in satellite imagery
- **Privacy concerns** with high-resolution imagery
- **Data storage** and transmission security
- **Access control** for datasets and models

#### Deployment Security
- **Model serving** endpoint security
- **Authentication and authorization** for API access
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Rate limiting** and abuse prevention

### ⏰ Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Status update**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Varies by complexity and severity

### 🛡️ Responsible Disclosure
We ask that you:
- **Give us reasonable time** to fix the issue before public disclosure
- **Avoid data theft** or privacy violations
- **Don't disrupt** our services or infrastructure
- **Act in good faith** to help improve security

### 🏆 Recognition
Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- **Acknowledged** in our security advisories (with permission)
- **Listed** in our hall of fame
- **Credited** in release notes

Thank you for helping keep our project and users safe! 🛡️
