==================================================
Analysis Date: 2025-07-14 09:28:46
Model: unet with resnet34

OVERALL STATISTICS:
  Total tiles analyzed: 50
  Slum areas detected: 0 tiles (0.0%)
  Non-slum areas: 50 tiles (100.0%)
  Average slum probability: 0.018
  Maximum slum probability: 0.085
  Average slum coverage: 0.0%

CONFIDENCE BREAKDOWN:
  High confidence: 50 tiles
  Medium confidence: 0 tiles
  Low confidence: 0 tiles

METHODOLOGY:
  - Used exact same preprocessing as successful training analysis
  - Applied ImageNet normalization and test-time transforms
  - Generated spatial probability maps for each tile
  - Created red overlays with 40% transparency
  - Classification threshold: 0.5

OUTPUT FILES:
  - Individual tile overlays: 52 files
